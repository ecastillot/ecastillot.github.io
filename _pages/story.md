I am always grateful to God, my wife Loren Osorio, my parents Edilberto Castillo and Blanca Taborda, and all the friends and family who have been part of my journey.

**When I Learned to Crawl in the World of Science**:  
I graduated in Physics from the [Universidad de Antioquia](https://www.udea.edu.co/wps/portal/udea/web/inicio), one of the top three universities in Colombia. It has a very strong physics program, where I built a solid foundation in mathematics and programming.  
I still remember my undergraduate colleagues with great appreciation, especially [Jeferson Colorado](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeferson-arboleda-colorado25/) and [Johan Vargas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jarbey-vargas/), who are both now working in the data science world. And  of course, [Carlos Toro](https://carlosatoroc.github.io/), a physicist/pure mathematician in the academic world, and still now the most humble and smartest guy I have ever met in my life.

**My first steps in Geoscience World**: 

Everything changed when I took a Geophysics elective with Professor [Gloria Moncayo](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gloria-Moncayo-2). That course strongly motivated me to become a geophysicist.  
During my last semester as a physics student, I decided to move to Bogotá and do an academic exchange at the [Universidad Nacional de Colombia](https://unal.edu.co/) (UNAL), which has the strongest geophysics program in the country. There, I worked with Professor [Carlos Vargas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XP2-qXUAAAAJ&hl=es). He and the UNAL research team welcomed and trained me in an incredible way: [Juan Manuel Solano](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmsolanof/), [Nicolas Pinzon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicol%C3%A1s-pinz%C3%B3n-matap%C3%AD-64b430172/), [Carla Lagardere](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carla-lagard%C3%A8re-933283221/), and [Sebastian Gomez Alba](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastian-gomez-alba-a0747169/). All of them are currently working in different areas of Geoscience.  
I also met Adolfo, Sandra, Lindsay, and many other wonderful people who made my life in Bogotá happier, both personally and professionally.

**My First Steps as a Seismologist:**

My experience with the UNAL research team provided incredible training, especially working with software such as SEISAN and SeisComP. Thanks to that preparation, I gained the skills necessary to be accepted as a Seismic Analyst at the [Colombian National Seismic Network](https://www.sgc.gov.co/sismos).  
For me, it was one of the best places to begin a career in seismology. I processed thousands of earthquake signals triggered by crustal faults, subduction zones, volcanoes, and even human-induced seismicity.  
Although it was a professional work environment, there was still room for research. My perspective expanded tremendously, and I still maintain connections with many of my colleagues — as friends, research collaborators, and even current coworkers. The geoscience world is small.  

When I started, I had the opportunity to work with: [Daniel Martinez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-mart%C3%ADnez-75568393/), [Oscar Suarez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oscar-daniel-suarez-mejia-7a2653173/), [Adolfo Robayo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adolfo-david-robayo-robayo-02a515188/), [Leonardo Mateus](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lsmateusb/), [Angel Agudelo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angel-daniel-agudelo-gonzalez/), [Daniel Siervo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dsiervo/), [Esteban Poveda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/esteban-poveda-ab55a758/), [Edwin Mayorga](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwin-mayorga-lopez-1647a7ab/), In my later stage, I also worked with: [Emmanuel Guzman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmanuel-guzm%C3%A1n-vitola-b6581b234/), [Laura Mercado](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laura-mercado-sol%C3%B3rzano-2082171a9/), [Geronimo Valencia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/geronimo-valencia-hoyos-824478192/), [Mariana Vergara](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/373899390_Variabilidad_del_estado_de_esfuerzos_en_la_region_del_volcan_Galeras_Colombia_a_partir_del_analisis_de_mecanismos_focales_de_sismos_volcanotectonicos), [Sebastian Gomez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juan-sebasti%C3%A1n-g%C3%B3mez-camacho-4419841a5/), [Juan Soriano](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jssorianop/). 

I could mention many more names, but my main purpose is to express my immense gratitude to all of them.

**Deepening My Path in Seismology: My Master’s in Geophysics**

During my first professional experience as a seismic analyst, I realized I needed to strengthen my research capacity. At the same time, the unexpected and quiet period of COVID-19 — together with this crazy (and brilliant) guy [Daniel Siervo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dsiervo/) — pushed me into the world of Artificial Intelligence.  
I began taking several AI courses on Coursera, including the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/TPV57STD456C), [TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/G53DLYL8V8LG), and others. That period completely reshaped the way I approached problems, allowing me to connect seismology with machine learning.  
With a clear goal of doing research at the intersection of seismology and AI, many colleagues recommended that I reach out to [German Prieto](https://gaprieto.com/) to be my advisor during my Master’s program in Geophysics. That decision was transformative.  
Together with Prof. German and [Daniel Siervo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dsiervo/), we developed the [first automatic earthquake catalog in Colombia using AI](https://gaprieto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/gprieto_24c.pdf), which later became my first publication in *Seismological Research Letters (SRL)*.  
I am deeply grateful to Prof. German for his constant support, brilliant ideas, and guidance — not only academically, but also in helping me navigate professional decisions.  
During this time, I also met [Sofia Cubillos](https://erlweb.mit.edu/people/sofia-cubillos/), a great friend and colleague. I am certain our paths will continue to cross in the scientific world.
